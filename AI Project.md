<a name="br1"></a>***Job Recommendation System***

***Project Description***

The job market is continuously evolving with an increasing number of job postings and

the need to attract the right talent. Job seekers face difficulty in finding the right job that

aligns with their skills and preferences. On the other hand, recruiters face challenges in

identifying the most suitable candidates for a job position.To solve this problem,we

developed a job recommendation model that aims to provide job seekers with a list of

job positions that are closely aligned with their skills and preferences. The model will

analyze the job postings, extract relevant features, and cluster them into different

categories to provide a personalized job recommendation list.The aim of this project is to

help job seekers find suitable job openings more efficiently, while also helping employers

reach potential candidates with the right skill set.

***Workflow of Project***

The system consists of several modules that work together to provide job

recommendations to users. The following is a description of each module:

***Data Collection Module***

The data collection module is responsible for collecting data from various job search

engines and websites. The module filtered out data to collect job postings, job

descriptions, and other relevant information. We filtered the data to only include IT job

postings and extracted the relevant features such as the job title, job description, and

job requirements. The data is stored in a database for later use.

***Data Preprocessing Module***

The next step in building the job recommendation model is to preprocess the data. We

first converted the text in each column to lowercase and removed any punctuation and

special characters. We then tokenized the text by splitting it into individual words and

removed any stop words. We also applied stemming to reduce each word to its root

form. Finally, we joined the words back into a single string.After preprocessing,it

vectorizes the text using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) from

the Scikit-learn library.

***Matching Algorithm***

Once the data preprocessing is performed, a matching algorithm is used to match job

seekers with relevant job postings. The matching algorithm uses machine learning

techniques such as clustering, classification, and recommendation systems to generate

job recommendations.Here, we performed clustering on the vectorized data to group

the job postings into different clusters. The Elbow method is used to determine the

optimal number of clusters.We assigned labels to each cluster and calculated the

Silhouette score to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm.

***Visualization***

We visualized the clustered data using a 2D scatter plot generated by reducing the

TF-IDF vectors into 2 dimensions. Each data point was color-coded based on its assigned

cluster label. We also generated a bar chart and a word cloud to visualize the most

frequent job titles.

***Job Recommendation***

Finally, we used the job recommendation model to recommend job positions to a job

seeker. We first asked the job seeker to input their skills and preferences, which we used

to generate a vector. We then used the same TF-IDF vectorizer used in clustering to

transform the job seeker vector. We then calculated the cosine similarity between the

job seeker vector and each job posting vector. We recommended the job postings with

the highest cosine similarity scores to the job seeker.

**External Help/References**

The following external references were used in the development of the job

recommendation system:

● Dataset: The project uses the job posting dataset from Kaggle

(<https://www.kaggle.com/>). The dataset contains job postings from various job

websites.

● Libraries: The project uses various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy,

Scikit-learn,Plotly,WordCloud,NLTK. These libraries provide functionality for data

processing, machine learning, and web development.

***Conclusion***

The job recommendation system is an effective tool for job seekers to find jobs that

match their skills and experience. The system uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to

recommend jobs to users based on their search history and profile information. The

system consists of several modules that work together to provide personalized job

recommendations to users. The project used several technologies and libraries, including

Python, Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, and Scikit-learn.

The job recommendation system has the potential to revolutionize the job search

process by providing users with personalized job recommendations based on their

search history and profile information.
